# Shiny-Badge

**Shiny-Badge** is a clean, responsive, and offline-first badge generator for developers.  
It’s a single self-contained HTML file that you can open in your browser to quickly design custom badges for your projects — no servers, no dependencies, no accounts required.

## 📖 About

Badges are one of the simplest ways to communicate project status, quality, or links at a glance.  
Whether you want to display **build status**, **documentation availability**, **version numbers**, or simply add a bit of style to your README — Shiny-Badge makes it easy.

Unlike online badge services, Shiny-Badge works entirely **client-side**.  
You can use it offline, customize colors freely, and export the badge directly as **Markdown**, **HTML**, or a **downloadable SVG**.
